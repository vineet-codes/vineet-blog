Do you have something to say ? Thats your idea

To whom you want to say it ? Thats your audience

What do you want them to feel ? Thats emotion you wanna be remembered for. 

communication = comprehension + emotion

The 3 questions to ask, Harry dry principle

1. Can I visualize it ? Make it concrete
2. Can i falsify it ? Don't talk, only point. 
3. Can nobody else say it ? if someone else can say the exact same thing, what is your diffrentiation angle ?

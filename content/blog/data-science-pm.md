I started my career optimizing hyperparameters for neural networks. Today, I optimize roadmaps for product teams. Surprisingly, the skill sets overlap more than you'd think.

### Parallels in Process

1.  **Hypothesis Driven Development:** In ML, you change one variable and observe the loss function. In Product, you ship one feature and observe the KPI.
2.  **Handling Uncertainty:** Deep learning models are often black boxes. Markets are also black boxes. You need to be comfortable making decisions with probabilistic outcomes rather than deterministic ones.
3.  **Bias:** In data, bias skews your model. In product, confirmation bias skews your strategy.

The transition required me to let go of the "how" (the code) and fall in love with the "why" (the user problem). It was a hard pivot, but my background in engineering gives me a distinct edge in assessing technical feasibility instantly during strategy sessions.

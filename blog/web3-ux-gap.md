title: Bridging the Gap: Web2 UX in a Web3 World
date: Oct 2024
summary: Why mass adoption relies on hiding the complexity of blockchain, not celebrating it.

The biggest barrier to blockchain adoption isn't scalability or gas fees—it's cognitive load. For years, we've asked users to understand private keys, gas limits, and RPC endpoints just to send a transaction. This is a failure of product, not technology.

At VeChain, specifically with the VeWorld wallet, my focus has been on abstraction. Users don't care about the database schema of their banking app; they shouldn't have to care about the consensus mechanism of their crypto wallet.

### The Invisible Plumbing

We are moving towards **Account Abstraction** and smart contract wallets where the blockchain becomes the invisible plumbing. The future of Web3 product management is building interfaces that feel deceptively simple, while leveraging the trustless security of the chain underneath.

Key areas we are focusing on:
1.  **Gas Abstraction**: Users shouldn't need a specific token to pay for fees.
2.  **Social Recovery**: Losing a key shouldn't mean losing your life savings.
3.  **Human Readable Signing**: No more signing random hex strings.

If we want the next billion users, we need to stop building for "Crypto Natives" and start building for humans.
